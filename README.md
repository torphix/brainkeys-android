# BrainKey

BrainKey is a keyboard app for Android that integrates LLMs directly into your keyboard

## Features

- **Prebuilt Prompts:** Save and load prebuilt prompts for quick and efficient use.
- **Query:** Dispatch the text in your current text field to the LLM and have the outputs streamed directly to your keyboard.
- **Continuation:** Generate continuations of the text in your currently focused text field
- **Local LLM Integration:** Direct integration of popular models such as [StableLM-2](https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/stablelm-2-zephyr-1_6b) and [Phi 2](https://huggingface.co/microsoft/phi-2) into your keyboard for offline use. This means none of your data leaves your phone.
